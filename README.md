# Concordia Simulation Builder

> Deploy de la demo: ver [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

A web interface for Google DeepMind's [Concordia](https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia) library that makes running agent-based social simulations accessible—no Python programming required.

Configure agents, psychological components, and scenarios through forms. Run simulations powered by LLMs. Analyze results with built-in analytics including timeline visualization, cooperation metrics, grounded variables tracking, and AI-powered deep content analysis.

## Why a Builder?

Concordia is a powerful research framework, but coding a simulation from scratch requires significant Python expertise. Even standard upstream examples — 2-to-4-agent scenarios using built-in prefabs — require 1,100 to 1,300 lines of Python across multiple files; examples with custom game masters and payoff logic reach 1,600 lines; research scenarios with large persona datasets exceed 7,000 lines. Each involves LLM initialization, agent configuration, memory injection, Game Master wiring, engine selection, and result parsing — all before the first simulation step executes.

| Without the Builder | With the Builder |
|---------------------|------------------|
| 1,100–7,000+ lines of Python per scenario | Configure through form fields and dropdowns |
| Discover valid prefabs by reading library source | Browse prefabs with descriptions and defaults |
| Invalid configs fail at runtime, after spending API credits | Real-time validation catches errors before execution |
| Terminal-only output, no way to pause or inspect mid-run | Play/Pause/Step/Stop controls with live log streaming |
| Kill the process to stop; restart from scratch to retry | Cancel with partial results saved; adjust and re-run |
| Build your own output pipeline | Structured HTML report, 9-tab analytics dashboard, AI-powered analysis |
| Write custom scripts for data extraction and analysis | Structured CSV/JSON export, cooperation metrics, grounded variable tracking |
| Manual agent creation, one at a time | Census-based generation from demographic distributions, persona generator |
| Re-run manually with different parameters | Batch runs with parameter sweeps over temperature and step count |
| Every new scenario is a new coding effort | 38 ready-to-run templates covering research, policy, game theory, upstream DeepMind examples, and more |

**v2.4.1 — Checkpoint Resume & Extend** is available on the `feat/resume-from-checkpoint` branch (tag: `v2.4.1`). This version adds two capabilities built on Concordia's native save/restore API:

- **Resume interrupted runs** — when a run is stopped (server restart, network loss, manual cancel), click **Resume** on any checkpoint in the Checkpoints panel to continue from that point. No template reload or re-entry of LLM settings required; all agent state, memories, and configuration are restored from a `.state.json` sidecar saved alongside each checkpoint HTML file.
- **Extend completed runs** — when a simulation finishes (whether the LLM terminated early or `max_steps` was reached), an **Extend** button appears on the Recent Simulations row. Enter how many additional steps to run and the simulation continues from its final state with full memory intact.

**Limitations:** resumption is not supported for simulations using `player_specific_context` (formative memory initializer may re-run); step-controller, interview, and survey engines are untested; `.state.json` sidecars store the API key in plaintext (avoid placing the `logs/` directory in shared or publicly accessible storage); the Extend button only appears for runs completed after upgrading to v2.4.1.

---

## Sample Simulation Results

Nine completed simulation runs are included in the [`logs/`](logs/) directory, spanning 8 distinct scenarios across 3 Game Master types. Each run was configured and executed entirely through the web interface using different LLM provider combinations.

Each simulation produces three output files:

- **`.html`** — Concordia simulation log (structured entries with full narrative)
- **`.metadata.json`** — Run metadata (agents, LLM config, GM config, timestamps, duration)
- **`_analysis.md`** — LLM-powered analysis report (executive summary, effectiveness assessment, insights, recommendations)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- API keys for at least one LLM provider (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, Anthropic, or GLM), OR Ollama for local models

### Backend Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ngstcf/concordia-sim-builder.git
cd concordia-sim-builder

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies (pins a patched Concordia 2.4.0 fork — see note below)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** `requirements.txt` pins a small **patched fork** of Concordia 2.4.0 ([`ngstcf/concordia`](https://github.com/ngstcf/concordia/tree/v2.4.0-simbuilder)), not the stock PyPI wheel. Two Game Master features — per-agent social-media activity rates and variable-increment clocks — depend on it; with the stock wheel, activity rates are silently ignored and the Mastodon influence experiment will not reproduce. `pip install -r requirements.txt` pulls the patched fork automatically. See [Local Modifications to Concordia](#local-modifications-to-concordia-v240) for what changed and why.

## Local Modifications to Concordia (v2.4.0)

The Builder runs against Concordia **v2.4.0** with two small local patches to Game Master prefabs — the tree that produced the published Mastodon influence experiment results. The patches are published as a public fork, [**`ngstcf/concordia@5ed8813`**](https://github.com/ngstcf/concordia/commit/5ed88134f7a08f2a13209b2e01bbb70a76d6771f) (branch `v2.4.0-simbuilder`), which `requirements.txt` pins directly. They are also captured as a standalone tracked patch for review and offline use: [`patches/concordia-2.4.0-local.patch`](patches/concordia-2.4.0-local.patch).

> **⚠️ Reproducibility:** the stock PyPI `gdm-concordia==2.4.0` does **not** contain these changes — with the unpatched library, per-agent activity rates are silently ignored (every agent posts on every step) and the Mastodon experiment will not reproduce. `requirements.txt` therefore pins the patched fork above, so `pip install -r requirements.txt` is sufficient.

### What changed and why

**1. `async_social_media__GameMaster` — per-agent stochastic activation** *(material)*

Stock v2.4.0 activates **every** eligible player on **every** step — its next-acting component simply returns all player names, with no notion of posting frequency. The Mastodon influence experiment depends on *differential* posting volume: a malicious actor posting at ~10× the baseline to dominate the feed, with the effect diluting as the honest population grows. That mechanism did not survive Concordia's upstream port of the prefab, so we re-introduced it at the GM level:

- Added `default_activity_rate`, `per_agent_activity_rates`, and `activity_seed` parameters.
- Added probabilistic per-agent sampling in the next-acting component (rate ≤ 1.0 → probability; rate > 1.0 → relative intensity, normalized to the most active agent).
- Seeded the RNG for reproducibility, and guaranteed the engine still advances when no agent is sampled in a step.

This is the GM-level mechanism behind the Builder's **Social Media Activity Model** sliders. Without it, the experiment's central manipulation — influence by posting volume — cannot be expressed.

**2. `simultaneous_resolution_gm__GameMasterSimultaneous` — variable-clock wiring** *(minor)*

The contrib clock already supported variable time increments, but the prefab never forwarded the configuration. The patch threads `use_variable_increments` and `variable_increment_rules` from GM params into the clock, enabling multi-interval / variable-step schedules from the Builder.

### Reproducing the patched environment

The published results used Concordia at commit `5482bca` (`git describe` → `v2.4.0-28-g5482bca`) plus the two patches above, published as the public fork [**`ngstcf/concordia@5ed8813`**](https://github.com/ngstcf/concordia/commit/5ed88134f7a08f2a13209b2e01bbb70a76d6771f) (branch `v2.4.0-simbuilder`).

**Default — pinned fork (one command).** `requirements.txt` already pins that commit, so a fresh clone reproduces it directly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt   # installs gdm-concordia from ngstcf/concordia@5ed8813
```

**Alternative — local editable install** (e.g. to keep developing against Concordia):

```bash
# Clone, pin the exact commit, apply the patch, install editable:
git clone https://github.com/google-deepmind/concordia concordia-upstream
cd concordia-upstream
git checkout 5482bca            # v2.4.0 + 28 commits — the exact tree this work used
git apply ../patches/concordia-2.4.0-local.patch
pip install -e .               # shadows the pinned PyPI gdm-concordia==2.4.0
```

## Troubleshooting

**ImportError: No module named 'concordia'**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Ollama timeouts** — Common with local models on slower hardware. Use DeepSeek or OpenAI for reliability.

**Anthropic "temperature is deprecated for this model"** — Handled automatically for Opus 4.7+ models (extended thinking mode rejects temperature).

**CORS errors** — Ensure backend runs on port 8000 and frontend `.env` has correct `VITE_API_URL`.

**Empty analytics tabs on older logs** — Pre-v2.4 logs use a different HTML format. The analytics parser handles both, but some tabs may have limited data.
